Introduction Section :\n\nDescription of the Problem and Background:\n\nScenario:\n\nI am a chef residing in Broward County Florida. I currently live within driving distance to Downtown Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton and I enjoy many ammenities and venues in the area, such as various international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. I have a dream to open a Peruvian Restaurant in Brooklyn, NY. I am very passionate about Peruvian Cuisine and I want to offer my inspirations to elaborate on those amazing \ndishes. To project my goals I have many questions and a few answers: How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place to start in Brooklyn? Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Brooklyn NY, I must set some basis, therefore the place in Brooklyn must meet the following demands:\n\n1.The place must be between 1000 - 1200 square feet.\\\n2.Desired location is near a Clinton Hill in the Brooklyn area and within 2.0 mile radius.\\\n3.Price of rent not exceed $14,000 per month.\\\n4.Top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence.\\\n5.Desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants Asian Thai, wine stores, gym and food shops.\n\nBusiness Problem:\n\nThe challenge is to find a friendly place for rent in Brooklyn NY that complies with the demands on location, price and venues. The data required to resolve this challenge is described in the following section 2, below.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\n## 2. Data Section:\nDescription of the data and its sources that will be used to solve the problem\n\nDescription of the Data:\n\nThe following data is required to answer the issues of the problem:\n\n1.List of Boroughs and neighborhoods of Brooklyn with their geodata (latitud and longitud).\\\n2.List of Subway metro stations in Brooklyn with their address location.\\\n3.List of places for rent in Brooklyn area with their addresses and price.\\\n4.Preferably, a list of place for rent with additional information, such as price, address, area, # of beds, etc.\\\n5.Venues for each Brooklyn neighborhood.\\ \n6.Venues for subway metro stations, as needed.\\\n\nHow the data will be used to solve the problem:\n\nThe data will be used as follows:\n\n1.Use Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Brooklyn neighborhoods and clustered in groups.\\ \n2.Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations, separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately.\\\n3.Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations.\\\n4.Create a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 2.0 mile around each subway station - or a similar metrics. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\\\n5.Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata(lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\\\n6.Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\\\n\nThe procesing of these DATA will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n\n1.what is the cost of rent (per square ft) around a mile radius from each subway metro station?\\\n2.what is the area of Brooklyn with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?\\\n3.What are the venues of the two best places to rent? How the prices compare?\\\n4.How venues distribute among Brooklyn neighborhoods and around metro stations?\\\n5.Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\\\n6.Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "address = 'Lafayette Ave, Brooklyn NY'\n\ngeolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"foursquare_agent\")\nlocation = geolocator.geocode(address)\nlatitude = location.latitude\nlongitude = location.longitude\nprint('The geograpical coordinate of Brooklyn NY are {}, {}.'.format(latitude, longitude))", "execution_count": 9, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "The geograpical coordinate of Brooklyn NY are 40.6863074, -73.9744304.\n", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "CLIENT_ID = 'Not for share' #
